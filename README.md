Transaction Tracker is a Flutter-based mobile app designed for digital product sellers to manage financial transactions efficiently. It tracks sales of mobile credit, electricity tokens, e-wallet top-ups, game vouchers, and data packages. The app provides a summary of total, successful, and pending transactions, along with a structured list of transaction details. Users can add new transactions, update payment statuses, and delete unnecessary records, ensuring an organized and seamless transaction management experience.
